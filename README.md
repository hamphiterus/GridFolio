The Problem
Keeping track of the events, workshops, projects, that you have on your schedule or that you have already attend can be a real hassle, and when it comes down to register what you have done on your portfolio or curriculum, well, it can be a real headache to say the least. Plus not forgetting that there's also the need of prof that what you're clamming.

Our Idea
To tackle the problem we tough about creating a mobile application whit a friendly interface and tools to help both keep track of possible future activities, record the ones done, providing a historical of activities, helping you build your portfolio, keep track of your work and even building your Curriculum.

An application developed to obtain approval on a university course.
